## Ismail Family

Meet the OG prophet, Abraham, a.k.a Ibrahim or Ibraheem, the pioneer prophet in the Quranic saga. His father's name is Azar. He has three children named Ismael, Ishaaq, and Yaqub. All three kids are considered prophets in the Quran.

Prophet Ismael goes by Ismail, Ishmael, and Ismaeil. He's the first son of Ibrahim, also known as Ibrahem, Abraham, and Ibraheem. The Quran talks about Ibrahim's wife but doesn't mention her name. Some traditions say it's Sarah or Sara or Sarai, but that's just a story and isn't confirmed by the Quran.

Ibrahim has two more sons. His second son, Ishaq, is also known as Isaac or Ishaaq. The third son is Yaqoob, also called Jacob. Notably, Jacob is different from Israel, mentioned separately in the Quran as a truthful person. Ismael is established as the firstborn. In the Quran, Ibrahim's wife is described as 'barren' (Aqeem), meaning she couldn't have kids. It's also clarified that she was 'old' (Ajoz), suggesting an inability to have children due to age.

### Ibrahim and Ismail story of building the kabah in Makkah:

In Chapter Two of the Quran, Ibrahim and Ismail are at the House of Allah, joining together in a heartfelt prayer. What makes this supplication significant is that it's in the plural form, emphasizing their unity in asking for a Rasool (Messenger) from their Muslim descendants. It's a powerful moment symbolizing their anticipation of a special Messenger coming from their own family, a theme that resonates throughout the Quran.

### Ibrahim and Ismael story of Sacrifice:

This story is in Quran and according the the story no one was sacrificed. The story of sacrifice has more to do with the separation of father and his beloved son Ismael.
The dream of Ibrahim in the Quran 3:102 is about Allah asking him to cast away his son (Ismael) and leave him in Makkah. It is a great trial of separation between the beloved father and the son.

Once Ibrahim understood the dream, where Allah asked him to cast away his son and leave him in Makkah, he told his son (Ismael) and asked for his opinion. The son replied, 'O father, do as you see fit; you will find me among the ones who persevere.'

Now comes the interesting part. As you may have seen in my old post where I discussed the use of foreign words in the Quran, I showed you how Allah used 'Darham' instead of 'Dinar.'

Well, you will be surprised that in the next verse, 3:103, Allah used words from two different cultures, giving you the trail of Ibrahim from the Indus Valley to Persia and finally to Arabia.

'Talla' is not an Arabic word; it has its roots in Sanskrit. According to Yates Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 'Talla' (तल्ल) means a reservoir or large tank, a hole, a pit, a deep place.

'Jabin/Jabeen' is also not from the Arabic language; it has Hebrew/Persian origin, meaning pure, beautiful, the one who is distinguished. In Persian and Indo/Pak, girls' names like Mah-Jabin mean extremely pure or beautiful. Additionally, the River Ganga's name in Persian is 'Jabeen.' We all know that Ganga is a sacred river representing the Goddess of purity and cleanser of sins.

Hence, the correct translation 
> _{{< qurantext chapter="37" verse=103 en="true" >}}_


As you continue to read the verse, Allah not only accepted his significant sacrifice of separation from his beloved son but also rewarded Ibrahim with two extra sons, Ishaq and Yaqoob. And hence the translation, 'They both totally surrendered to Allah, and guess what? He created a reservoir (well) for it (Zamzam) for the ones who are pure' makes complete sense.



### Criticism on the fabricated story of Hajjar and that Ismail was left in Makkah at a very young age:
The main criticism of this narrative, suggesting that Ishmael was left in Makkah at a young age and Isaac was sacrificed instead, is challenged on three grounds according to the Quran.

Firstly, it contradicts the Quran's statements about a crucial event. It is strongly implied in the Quran that when Abraham settled Ishmael in Makkah, he was already a grown-up boy and not an infant. This deduction is supported by historical facts mentioned in the Quran:

i. Abraham settled Ishmael in Makkah after the birth of his younger brother, Isaac.
ii. Isaac was born after Abraham had offered Ishmael for sacrifice, a heroic act rewarded by the Almighty.
iii. At the time of sacrifice, Ishmael was described as a young boy who could run around.

Considering these facts:
a. The age difference between Ishmael and Isaac was likely around ten to twelve years.
b. Ishmael must have been a young lad when he came to Makkah with his father to settle there.

The relevant Quranic verses supporting these points are as follows: 
> _{{< qurantext chapter="14" verse=35 en="true" >}}_
> _{{< qurantext chapter="14" verse=36 en="true" >}}_
> _{{< qurantext chapter="14" verse=37 en="true" >}}_
> _{{< qurantext chapter="14" verse=38 en="true" >}}_
> _{{< qurantext chapter="14" verse=39 en="true" >}}_


This is Abraham's prayer when he was setting up Ishmael in Makkah. He's like, "Thanks, God, for giving me up with Ishmael and Isaac in my golden years." So, basically, both Ishmael and Isaac were already on the scene.

Now consider the following verses:

### Ishaq and Yaqub born after Ismail
And the last proof is the verse
> _{{< qurantext chapter="21" verse=72 en="true" >}}_

From the emphasized part of these verses, "And We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac," it becomes apparent that Abraham received the news of Isaac's birth after the incident involving the sacrifice of Ishmael. This implies that Isaac was not even born when Ishmael was offered for separation. The initial words of the verses suggest that Ishmael must have been a budding youngster at that time, able to walk with his father.

In essence, this implies that Ishmael was an older youth, more than 10-12 years older than Isaac. Since both sons were already born when Abraham settled Ishmael in Makkah, it indicates that Ishmael was not an infant but a budding young man, contrasting with the narrative's claim of him being an infant.
And Allah knows best.
