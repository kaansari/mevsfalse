## Introduction

Eesa is a Messenger of Allah and the second last Prophet for the Children of Israel. The ultimate and final Prophet for both the Children of Israel and all of humanity is Mohammad. In this divine lineage, Eesa's mother is Mariam known as Hathor and [Isis](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~djbromle/art-symbolism/student-projects-2001/isis-rasnic.html)

His father is Zakariah and in ancient Egypt he is [Osiris](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Osiris-Egyptian-god).

He is know as Horus in the Egyptian methology. He was aided by the Holy Spirit/ Amun Rouh or Ruh Alamin [Yusuf](yusuf.html).

## Esa's Parents

His mother is Mariam who is the daugther of Imran/Imhotep.  Mariam is the sister or Harun and [Musa](musaisnotjibreel.html).

His father is ZA KA RI YA.  His names means the one who reaches out to YA.  His father came to Mariam as a messenger from Allah to give her the son.  This story is mentioned in Chapter 3 and 19 of the Quran.  Zakaria is either from the progeny of Ishaaq or he is Ishaaq himself.

## How did Esa die

Eesa (Jesus) passed away, similar to how other prophets departed. He was neither crucified nor killed, as the term "crucifixion" is often mistranslated in the Quran translations. The Quran specifies that his lineage was not disclosed, and nor he was killed by the Children of Israel.

## The name Esa is Egyptian just as Musa

His name is The Massih Eesau ibn Mariam. Massih means wiped or cleared. His name Yahya has been wiped from history, and neither Jews nor Christians have a prophet whose name is Yahya.



## What is Massiah

Massih means wiped or forgotten.  His forgotten name is Yahya, and in the Quran, Yahya and Esa are actually the same child. His name "Yahya" was originally told to his father Zakaria, but Zakaria passed away before Yahya was born. Allah had a special message for Mariam: keep things quiet about Esa being Zakaria's son. Instead, call him "Esa Son of Mariam." Keep his lineage secret. Exactly! That's the deal – keep Esa Son Mariam's lineage a secret. That's why he wasn't "Salaboho," meaning his family background wasn't disclosed.

## Eye of Horus - Esa

Just as Musa, Esa is also an egyptian name.  His name Ee (Eye) Sau (Devine, Priest, Magic) meaning the [Eye of Sau](https://egyptian-fever.com/blogs/infos/eye-of-horus-vs-eye-of-ra-differences-and-similarities) or Eye of the Devine.

## The story of Esa was unknown

Allah says in the Quran that the story of Eesa is from Ghaib (3:44), meaning it was unknown. The Quran narrates a tale that was hidden until 1940, before the decoding of Egyptian hieroglyphics. This suggests that neither Jews nor Christians possess any records of what the Quran reveals about Eesa.

## Esa Horus as bird

In Quran 3:49, there is a clear reference when Zakaria (Angel) says to his mother how he will be like one prepared by the birds, and then he will become a bird. Of course, Allah knew that he would be preserved in history with the bird symbol, and that's why Allah mentioned him in such a way for people to recognize.

## Esa in the Quran

He is mainly mentioned in Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 17, 18, and 19. The stories are disjointed, and until you read all the related verses, you will not get a complete picture.


## Full Story of Esa son of Mariam / Jesus

Mariam, the daughter of Imran (also known as Imhotep), lived in the time when her father served as a vizier in the Pharaoh's court. Imhotep was an extraordinary person, a genius and a polymath, but sadly, he passed away before Musa's birth.

Now, the events suggests that Musa had a different mother than Harun and Mariam, but they all shared Imhotep as their father. This is why they are called Aal Imran. Despite Imhotep's passing, his influence lingered.

Mariam, being Imhotep's daughter, had a special connection. Her access to the palace allowed her to play a unique role. It was Mariam who told Maat, the person who found Musa by the river, about his true mother. The tale unfolds with family ties, ancient courts, and a touch of mystery.

As Mariam grew older, and while Musa was growing up in the palace, she decided to seek wisdom from Zakariah, the King of his people known for his vast knowledge. Mariam chose to stay with him to learn from his wealth of experience and understanding.

Zakariah found himself in a challenging predicament - he had no children, and the elites and nobles around him were scheming to remove him from power. The weight of concern grew as he worried about who would inherit the kingdom and continue caring for the people after him. To make matters worse, his own brother Seth was involved in the scheme, adding a personal layer of complexity to the difficult situation.

However, Zakariah never lost hope in the mercy of his Rab. He fervently prayed for a son who would inherit from him and carry on his and the legacy of the family of Jacob.

The only moments of solace for Zakariah came when he was teaching and spending time with Mariam. In those times, the weight of his worries lifted, and he found comfort in their shared moments of learning and companionship.

Every time Zakariah entered the Mehrab, where Mariam studied, he found Mariam immersed in new words, chants, and enchantations. He would ask her, "Where did you learn this?" She would reply, "Allah gives to whoever He wants without account."


Right there and then, Zakariah asked once more, and the angel appeared, delivering the joyful news of a son named Yahya. Seeking a sign, Zakariah was instructed to remain silent for 3 days and to remember and mention the name of his Lord day and night.

Allah then instructed Mariam that she had been chosen above all the women in the world. She was told to pray with a low voice, signifying quiet devotion, and to join in prostration with those who were prostrating, indicating Zakariah.  Also, she was told that her sons name would be Massiah Esa Ibn Mariam.

At this time, Allah reminds us that these stories are from the unknown world, and no one else knows these particular narratives. So, there's no need to search for them in the Bible or any other source; they are exclusive to the teachings of Allah.

When Zakariah noticed that Mariam was praying with him and maintaining quiet attitude, it became a sign to him that Allah had chosen her. Approaching her as a messenger of Allah, he conveyed the news that she would be granted a son. In response, Mariam, showing her spirited nature from her noble lineage, exclaimed, "You!? Fear Allah, if you were that good."

> _This detial is in the quran 3:33 and 19_

Before the son was born, Zakariah's enemies became brazen and took drastic measures. They killed him and gruesomely cut him into pieces <cite>[^2]</cite>. The situation escalated as they argued and unjustly confined Mariam, aiming to seize the noble woman for their own motives.

Musa, Mariam's brother, received the news and promptly ordered them to release her from imprisonment. In disbelief, they retorted, "Are you joking with us?" making it clear that they pretended not to understand his command.

Musa sternly responded, "Do you think I am ignorant of your crimes? You take me for an idiot?" He pointed out that the woman he was referring to was neither too old nor too young, making it clear that he was well aware of their deceitful actions.

![Landscape](../img/articles/cow.jpg)

They couldn't believe that Musa was aware of their actions. In an attempt to confirm, they asked about the woman's complexion. Musa confidently replied, "She is fair-skinned, the kind of woman you admire." His response indicated a profound knowledge that left them astounded.

Despite Musa's clear knowledge of their crime, they still refused to believe it. They replied, "Oh, we really don't know what you are talking about, and the description of the woman is confusing to us. We hope God will guide us."

Musa responded, "This is the woman who does not read your scripture, nor does she engage with you to give you guidance." As soon as they heard this, they realized he was talking about Mariam. Consequently, they had no choice but to release her.

> _This detial is in the quran 2:68 also in the <cite>Book of the Heavenly Cow. [^4]</cite>
[^4]: These episodes are characterized by Egyptologists as a type of story known as the Distant Goddess and they always involve a transformation of some sort. [Link](https://www.worldhistory.org/Book_of_the_Heavenly_Cow/)._

Mariam delivered the baby, shedding tears and feeling the absence of her husband. In her emotional state, she cried out to Allah for help. At that moment, Allah inspired her from her core, reassuring her that everything would be fine. She learned that her son would emerge as a shoot from a seemingly lifeless trunk, and Allah would bless her with new guidence- never revealed before.

Returning to Egypt, Mariam entered the palace and encountered her aunt Maat. The people in the palace, curious about the child, questioned her. Following Allah's command to remain silent, Mariam simply pointed her finger towards the child, Yahya began to speak. He described himself exactly as the angel had informed his late father, Zakariah. 

> _This detial is in the quran 19_

Indeed, Yahya was Esa Ibn Mariam, and Allah concealed his lineage from the people in the palace to prevent questioning of his rightful claim to the throne. With the last Pharaoh having met his demise in the confrontation with Musa, the throne now stood vacant. The only legitimate heir for the throne was the grandson of Imhotep, meaning Esa.

Esa receives the finest upbringing in the palace, under the guidance of two formidable women, Mariam (Isis) and Maat (Mother of Moses). He lives a life of luxury and grows into a powerful young prince.

Now that Seth and others realized their crime - the murder of Zakariah - had been exposed, they began to hide. However, Allah commanded them to travel to Egypt with some parts of Zakariah's inheritance. Instead of following Allah's directive, they seized this opportunity to lay claim to the throne and attempted to become the king and to create trouble for the young prince.

> _This detial is in the quran 2:73_


In the palace, Esa makes a new friend, [Yusuf](yusuf.html). They both grow up together, sharing experiences and forming a strong bond in their royal surroundings.
