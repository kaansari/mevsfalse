## Introduction
Abrogation (naskh) in the Qur'an refers to the concept that some verses were revealed with specific rulings that were later replaced or superseded by other verses. The idea is that earlier verses, while initially applicable, were later abrogated by new revelations that provided clearer or more comprehensive rulings.


Shah Waliullah Dehlavi, a prominent Islamic scholar and reformer from India, contributed extensively to Islamic thought and jurisprudence. He is known for his works on tafsir, fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and hadith, and he also made significant contributions to the understanding of **abrogation** (naskh) in the Qur'an. Abrogation refers to the idea that some verses of the Qur'an were revealed to be applicable for a certain period or context but were later replaced or superseded by other verses.<cite>[^1]</cite>

Shah Waliullah Dehlavi's view on abrogation in the Qur'an is found in his work [Al-Fawz al-Kabir fi Usul al-Tafsir](/pdf/Fauzkabir.pdf). In this work, he discusses various verses that are considered abrogated, and his views are generally based on classical Islamic scholarship, especially the interpretations of earlier scholars.

Below is a list of some of the key **abrogated verses** (verses related to **naskh**) according to Shah Waliullah Dehlavi:


### 1. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:180) - The Inheritance and Will

This verse of Will and Inhetance was later abarigated

The detailed rulings regarding inheritance are clarified and expanded upon in **Surah An-Nisa (4:7)** and **Surah An-Nisa (4:12)**, where the inheritance shares are clearly outlined.

### 2. Surah Al-Anfal (8:65 → 8:66): Reduction in Combat Ratio 
- **Original Command (8:65):** Muslims were required to fight enemies at a ratio of 1:10.

> _{{< qurantext chapter="8" verse=65 en="true" >}}_

- **Abrogation (8:66):** The ratio was reduced to 1:2 due to their limited strength and Allah’s mercy.

> _{{< qurantext chapter="8" verse=66 en="true" >}}_


### 3. Surah Al-Ahzab (33:52 → 33:50): Flexibility in Marital Relations of the Prophet
- **Original Command (33:50):** The Prophet ﷺ was permitted to marry specific categories of women.  

> _{{< qurantext chapter="33" verse=50 en="true" >}}_

- **Abrogation (33:52):** The Prophet ﷺ was given flexibility to defer or choose his time with his wives, ensuring ease and fairness in his personal matters.

> _{{< qurantext chapter="33" verse=52 en="true" >}}_

Note: I disagree with him on this abrogation, and I think these two verses read just fine according to their placement.


### 4. Surah Al-Mujadila (58:12 → 58:13): Cancellation of Charity Requirement 
- **Original Command (58:12):** Muslims were required to give charity before privately consulting the Prophet ﷺ.

> _{{< qurantext chapter="58" verse=12 en="true" >}}_

- **Abrogation (58:13):** The charity requirement was lifted to ease the burden on believers, as many found it difficult to comply.

> _{{< qurantext chapter="58" verse=13 en="true" >}}_


### 5. Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:1-4 → 73:20): Reduction in Night Prayer Obligation  
- **Original Command (73:1-4):** The Prophet ﷺ and his followers were commanded to spend most of the night in prayer. 

> _{{< qurantext chapter="73" verse=1 en="true" >}}_

> _{{< qurantext chapter="73" verse=2 en="true" >}}_

> _{{< qurantext chapter="73" verse=3 en="true" >}}_

> _{{< qurantext chapter="73" verse=4 en="true" >}}_

- **Abrogation (73:20):** The obligation was reduced, allowing flexibility based on individual ability, recognizing the challenges faced by the believers.

## False Claims of Abrogated or Missing Verses

The hadith about a goat eating verses of the Qur'an related to breastfeeding (**Ayat al-Rada'a**) has been a topic of controversy. It suggests that certain verses, which prescribed ten sucklings to make marriage unlawful, were lost when a goat ate the written text. This narration is primarily found in **Sunan Ibn Majah** (Hadith 1944) and attributed to **Aisha (رضي الله عنها)**. It also appears in other narrations, though without the goat reference. Scholars debate the authenticity of these claims.

#### Hadith from **Sunan Ibn Majah** (1944):

Arabic:  
**حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو بَكْرٍ وَعَبْدُ الرَّحْمَنِ ابْنُ أَصْبَغٍ، قَالا حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى بْنُ يَحْيَى التَّمِيمِيُّ، حَدَّثَنَا هُشَيْمٌ، عَنْ حُسَيْنِ بْنِ عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ، عَنْ زُهَيْرِ بْنِ مُحَمَّدٍ، عَنْ عُبَيْدَةَ، عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، قَالَتْ: "كَانَ فِي مَا أُنْزِلَ مِنَ القُرْآنِ: عَشْرُ رَضَعَاتٍ مُحَرِّمَاتٌ، فَمَاتَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ وَهُنَّ فِي مَا يُقْرَأُ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ، فَسَحَتْهَا قُرَيْشٌ وَقَالُوا: تَرَكْنَاهُ قُرْبَ الْمَوْتِ".**

Translation:  
Aisha (رضي الله عنها) said:  
"There was revealed in the Qur'an (a verse): Ten breastfeedings make marriage unlawful. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) passed away, and these verses were still recited in the Qur'an. Later, these verses were erased and forgotten."

### Similar Narrations in Other Sources

1. **Sahih Muslim (Hadith 3011)**:  
Arabic:  
**كَانَ فِي مَا أُنْزِلَ مِنَ القُرْآنِ: عَشْرُ رَضَعَاتٍ مُحَرِّمَاتٌ، ثُمَّ نُسِخَ إِلَى خَمْسِ رَضَعَاتٍ.**  

Translation:  
"There was revealed in the Qur'an: Ten sucklings make marriage unlawful, then it was abrogated to five sucklings."

2. **Sunan Abu Dawood (Hadith 3734)**:  
Arabic:  
**كَانَ فِي مَا أُنْزِلَ مِنَ القُرْآنِ عَشْرُ رَضَعَاتٍ مُحَرِّمَاتٌ، فَمَاتَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ وَهُنَّ فِي مَا يُقْرَأُ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ.**  

Translation:  
"There was revealed in the Qur'an: Ten sucklings make marriage unlawful. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) passed away, and these verses were still recited in the Qur'an."

### Scholarly Analysis

1. **Weakness in Authenticity**:  
   Many scholars consider the narration involving the goat eating the verses weak or fabricated, as it implies that portions of the Qur'an were lost, which contradicts the Qur'an's promise of preservation:  
   > **"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an, and indeed, We will be its guardian."** *(Surah Al-Hijr 15:9)*  

2. **Abrogation and Forgetfulness**:  
   Some narrations suggest these verses were abrogated during the Prophet's lifetime or deliberately forgotten as part of divine will, not due to external events like a goat eating the text.

3. **Theological Concerns**:  
   Claims of lost verses challenge the belief in the Qur'an's complete preservation. This is why many scholars reject the literal interpretation of such narrations or their authenticity altogether.

## **False Stoning Law and the Abrogation of Recitation**  

### **Hadith of Umar ibn al-Khattab (Sahih Bukhari 6829)**  
Umar ibn al-Khattab said:  
“Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ with the truth and revealed the Book to him, including the verse of stoning, which we recited, understood, and implemented. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ practiced stoning, and so did we. I fear a time when people will say, ‘We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah,’ leading them astray by abandoning an obligation Allah revealed. Stoning is the truth for married adulterers when proven by evidence, pregnancy, or confession.”

### **Sunni Opinion on the Abrogation of Stoning Verse Recitation**  
Some Sunni scholars explain this as **naskh tilawah** (abrogation of recitation but retention of the ruling). They argue the verse was part of the Qur'an but later removed from recitation, while its ruling remains valid.  

1. **Criticism of Naskh Tilawah**:  
   - There’s no evidence from hadith that the Prophet ﷺ abrogated any Qur'anic verse.  
   - It’s implausible to forget a memorized verse, as such a verse would still be widely known.  

2. **Ruling in Islamic Law**:  
   - Stoning is upheld through authentic hadiths describing the Prophet ﷺ implementing it.  
   - Scholars like **Imam Al-Shafi'i, Imam Malik, and Imam Ahmad** maintain it is enforceable, though it may have applied only to Jews and Christians, aligning with their scriptures and laws.
