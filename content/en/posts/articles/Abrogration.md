**No Abrogation in the Qur’an**  

There is no abrogation (naskh) in the Qur’an. All its verses remain valid and harmonious. When chapter 2 mentions abrogation, it refers to the replacement of previous scriptures with the superior guidance of the Qur’an, not the cancellation of Qur’anic verses themselves.

### Examples Often Misinterpreted as Abrogation .<cite>[^1]</cite>

1. **Inheritance and Will (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:180 → Surah An-Nisa 4:7, 4:12):**  
   The detailed inheritance laws in Surah An-Nisa complement the will command in Surah Al-Baqarah, ensuring fairness without negating the principle of writing a will.

2. **Combat Ratio (Surah Al-Anfal 8:65 → 8:66):**  
   The shift from a 1:10 to a 1:2 ratio in battle reflects Allah’s mercy and the believers’ capacity. This is a contextual easing, not an abrogation.

3. **Marital Rules for the Prophet ﷺ (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:50 → 33:52):**  
   Both verses address different aspects of the Prophet’s ﷺ personal life, offering flexibility without contradiction.

4. **Charity Before Consulting the Prophet ﷺ (Surah Al-Mujadila 58:12 → 58:13):**  
   The lifting of the charity requirement alleviated a burden on believers. This demonstrates practical adjustments, not abrogation.

5. **Night Prayer Obligation (Surah Al-Muzzammil 73:1-4 → 73:20):**  
   The reduction in prayer time acknowledges believers’ challenges, allowing individual flexibility while maintaining the essence of devotion.

### Addressing Misconceptions  

Claims such as the "goat-eating verses" narrative, found in some hadith, lack authenticity and contradict the Qur’an’s preservation. The Qur’an is complete, without loss or alteration, as promised by Allah in Surah Al-Hijr (15:9): *“Indeed, We have sent down the Qur’an, and indeed, We will be its guardian.”*  


## **False Stoning Law and the Abrogation of Recitation**

 
Umar ibn al-Khattab (Sahih Bukhari 6829) stated:  
“Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ with the truth and revealed the Book to him, including the verse of stoning, which we recited and implemented. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ practiced stoning, and so did we. I fear people may later abandon this obligation, claiming the verse is absent in the Qur'an. Stoning is the truth for married adulterers proven by evidence, pregnancy, or confession.”

### **Sunni Opinion on the Abrogation of Stoning Verse Recitation**  
**Naskh Tilawah** (abrogation of recitation, retention of ruling) is cited by some Sunni scholars:  
- **Criticism**:  
  - No clear hadith confirms the Prophet ﷺ abrogated a Qur'anic verse.  
  - Forgotten verses would still be widely known if recited earlier.  

- **Ruling in Law**:  
  - Stoning is validated through authentic hadiths showing the Prophet ﷺ implemented it.  
  - Scholars like **Imam Al-Shafi'i, Imam Malik, and Imam Ahmad** uphold its enforcement, possibly specific to Jews and Christians under their laws.
