### Abrogation in the Qur'an: A Clearer Perspective

The concept of abrogation (naskh) in the Qur’an suggests that certain verses were revealed for a specific context but were later replaced by others. However, I firmly believe there is no abrogation in the Qur’an; all verses remain valid and harmonious in their meanings. Below are examples often cited as abrogated, along with my reasoning that they are not.

1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:180) - Inheritance and Will**  
   Critics claim this verse, which enjoins a will for parents and relatives, is abrogated by detailed inheritance laws in Surah An-Nisa (4:7, 4:12).  
   **Reason**: The concept of a will (wasia) complements the inheritance laws. It ensures fairness beyond fixed shares, fulfilling a moral obligation toward loved ones.  

2. **Surah Al-Anfal (8:65 → 8:66) - Combat Ratios**  
   Initially, believers were commanded to fight at a 1:10 ratio, later reduced to 1:2.  
   **Reason**: This is not abrogation but a contextual adjustment based on believers’ strength. Both verses coexist to reflect Allah’s wisdom in addressing evolving circumstances.

3. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:50 → 33:52) - Marital Permissions for the Prophet ﷺ**  
   These verses discuss marital allowances and restrictions for the Prophet ﷺ. Some argue verse 52 cancels the previous allowances.  
   **Reason**: Both verses align without conflict. They emphasize fairness and balance in personal matters, tailored to the Prophet’s unique responsibilities.

4. **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:12 → 58:13) - Charity Before Consultation**  
   The command to give charity before private discussions with the Prophet ﷺ was later eased.  
   **Reason**: This is not abrogation but a facilitation for those struggling financially. Both commands address different capacities of believers.

5. **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:1-4 → 73:20) - Night Prayer Obligation**  
   The initial obligation for extensive night prayers was relaxed in verse 20.  
   **Reason**: This adjustment reflects Allah’s mercy, allowing believers to pray according to their ability. Both instructions remain relevant for varying levels of devotion.

### False Claims of Abrogated or Missing Verses  
The controversial claim that certain verses were “lost” (e.g., the breastfeeding verse allegedly eaten by a goat) lacks strong evidence. Such narrations, primarily found in secondary sources, are weak and do not undermine the Qur’an's completeness and preservation.

Here is a concise and clear version of the article emphasizing that there is no abrogation in the Qur’an:

**No Abrogation in the Qur’an**  

There is no abrogation (naskh) in the Qur’an. All its verses remain valid and harmonious. When chapter 2 mentions abrogation, it refers to the replacement of previous scriptures with the superior guidance of the Qur’an, not the cancellation of Qur’anic verses themselves.

### Examples Often Misinterpreted as Abrogation .<cite>[^1]</cite>

1. **Inheritance and Will (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:180 → Surah An-Nisa 4:7, 4:12):**  
   The detailed inheritance laws in Surah An-Nisa complement the will command in Surah Al-Baqarah, ensuring fairness without negating the principle of writing a will.

2. **Combat Ratio (Surah Al-Anfal 8:65 → 8:66):**  
   The shift from a 1:10 to a 1:2 ratio in battle reflects Allah’s mercy and the believers’ capacity. This is a contextual easing, not an abrogation.

3. **Marital Rules for the Prophet ﷺ (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:50 → 33:52):**  
   Both verses address different aspects of the Prophet’s ﷺ personal life, offering flexibility without contradiction.

4. **Charity Before Consulting the Prophet ﷺ (Surah Al-Mujadila 58:12 → 58:13):**  
   The lifting of the charity requirement alleviated a burden on believers. This demonstrates practical adjustments, not abrogation.

5. **Night Prayer Obligation (Surah Al-Muzzammil 73:1-4 → 73:20):**  
   The reduction in prayer time acknowledges believers’ challenges, allowing individual flexibility while maintaining the essence of devotion.

### Addressing Misconceptions  

Claims such as the "goat-eating verses" narrative, found in some hadith, lack authenticity and contradict the Qur’an’s preservation. The Qur’an is complete, without loss or alteration, as promised by Allah in Surah Al-Hijr (15:9): *“Indeed, We have sent down the Qur’an, and indeed, We will be its guardian.”*  


Here is the revised text in the requested concise format:

## **False Stoning Law and the Abrogation of Recitation**

### **Hadith of Umar ibn al-Khattab (Sahih Bukhari 6829)**  
Umar ibn al-Khattab stated:  
“Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ with the truth and revealed the Book to him, including the verse of stoning, which we recited and implemented. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ practiced stoning, and so did we. I fear people may later abandon this obligation, claiming the verse is absent in the Qur'an. Stoning is the truth for married adulterers proven by evidence, pregnancy, or confession.”

### **Sunni Opinion on the Abrogation of Stoning Verse Recitation**  
**Naskh Tilawah** (abrogation of recitation, retention of ruling) is cited by some Sunni scholars:  
- **Criticism**:  
  - No clear hadith confirms the Prophet ﷺ abrogated a Qur'anic verse.  
  - Forgotten verses would still be widely known if recited earlier.  

- **Ruling in Law**:  
  - Stoning is validated through authentic hadiths showing the Prophet ﷺ implemented it.  
  - Scholars like **Imam Al-Shafi'i, Imam Malik, and Imam Ahmad** uphold its enforcement, possibly specific to Jews and Christians under their laws.
