Abrogation (naskh) in the Qur'an refers to the concept that some verses were revealed with specific rulings that were later replaced or superseded by other verses. This principle acknowledges the progressive nature of divine revelation, where certain laws and guidelines were revealed in response to changing circumstances or evolving needs of the Muslim community. The idea is that earlier verses, while initially applicable, were later abrogated by new revelations that provided clearer or more comprehensive rulings. For instance, the verse in **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:219)**, which acknowledges the harms and benefits of alcohol, was abrogated by the more definitive prohibition in **Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:90)**. Similarly, verses concerning polygyny, such as **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:240)**, were further clarified and restricted by later revelations, emphasizing the importance of justice and limiting the practice. These instances of abrogation reflect the dynamic nature of Qur'anic guidance, which adapted to the evolving needs of the Muslim community, ensuring that the final rulings were most appropriate for their circumstances.


Shah Waliullah Dehlavi, a prominent Islamic scholar and reformer from India, contributed extensively to Islamic thought and jurisprudence. He is known for his works on tafsir, fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and hadith, and he also made significant contributions to the understanding of **abrogation** (naskh) in the Qur'an. Abrogation refers to the idea that some verses of the Qur'an were revealed to be applicable for a certain period or context but were later replaced or superseded by other verses.

Shah Waliullah Dehlavi's view on abrogation in the Qur'an is found in his work **"Al-Fawz al-Kabir fi Usul al-Tafsir"**. In this work, he discusses various verses that are considered abrogated, and his views are generally based on classical Islamic scholarship, especially the interpretations of earlier scholars.

Below is a list of some of the key **abrogated verses** (verses related to **naskh**) according to Shah Waliullah Dehlavi:

### 1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:219)** - Alcohol and Gambling
**Verse 219** of Surah Al-Baqarah talks about the harms and benefits of alcohol and gambling. According to some scholars, this verse was abrogated by **Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:90)**, which categorically prohibits alcohol and gambling.

**2:219**:  
**"They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, 'In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit.'"**

This was later abrogated by the clear prohibition in **5:90**, which explicitly forbids intoxicants and gambling:

**5:90**:  
**"O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful."**

### 2. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:240)** - The Inheritance of Widows
**Verse 240** of Surah Al-Baqarah talks about the inheritance of widows and the prescribed waiting period after the death of a husband. This verse is considered to be abrogated by later rulings on inheritance, which are more detailed in other parts of the Qur'an.

**2:240**:  
**"And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind, for their wives is a bequest: they shall be provided for and given a year's maintenance without turning [them] out; but if they leave, there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable manner."**

The detailed rulings regarding inheritance are clarified and expanded upon in **Surah An-Nisa (4:7)** and **Surah An-Nisa (4:12)**, where the inheritance shares are clearly outlined.

### 3. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:6)** - The Position of the Prophet's Wives
**Verse 6** of Surah Al-Ahzab mentions the high status of the Prophet’s wives and describes their elevated position in the community. This verse is believed to have been abrogated by later verses, especially concerning the treatment of the Prophet's wives, such as **Surah An-Nisa (4:3)** and the rulings on polygyny.

**33:6**:  
**"The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are [in relation to them] like their mothers."**

This is considered abrogated by other verses that clarify the rules regarding marriage and the limitations on polygyny, such as **Surah An-Nisa (4:3)**, where the Qur'an sets limits on the number of wives a man can marry.

### 4. **Surah Al-Nisa (4:3)** - Polygyny and the Rights of Orphans
The verse in Surah Al-Nisa discusses the treatment of orphans and women in the context of marriage. Some scholars, including Shah Waliullah, view it as abrogated by later verses regarding the specific rules of marriage and the limits on polygyny. While **4:3** allows for marrying up to four women, it sets the condition of justice, which was later modified by other rulings that required complete fairness and equal treatment.

**4:3**:  
**"And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphans, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one..."**

This verse was abrogated by the ruling in **Surah Al-Nisa (4:129)**, which clarifies that absolute justice in polygyny is difficult, and a man should marry only one if he cannot be just.

### 5. **Surah At-Tawbah (9:5)** - Fighting and the People of the Book
**Verse 5** of Surah At-Tawbah, often referred to as the "Verse of the Sword," commands Muslims to fight the polytheists. Some scholars view this verse as abrogating earlier verses that advocate for peaceful relations with non-believers, such as **2:190-194**.

**9:5**:  
**"Then when the sacred months have passed, kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush."**

This verse is interpreted as abrogating previous verses that allowed for peaceful coexistence with the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and others. Later verses in **Surah At-Tawbah (9:29)** and **Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:8-9)** provide clarification regarding relationships with non-Muslims.

### 6. **Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:51)** - Alliances with Non-Muslims
**Verse 51** of Surah Al-Ma’idah discusses the prohibition on taking Jews and Christians as allies, which some scholars consider to be abrogated by the more inclusive verses, especially when it comes to alliances and relationships with non-Muslims.

**5:51**:  
**"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another."**

This verse is viewed by some as abrogated by later rulings on peaceful coexistence and cooperation, particularly with the People of the Book.

### Conclusion:
Shah Waliullah Dehlavi’s views on abrogation reflect a nuanced understanding of how certain verses in the Qur'an may have been applicable in specific contexts but were later superseded by other rulings. The verses listed above are among those he considered to be abrogated, though these interpretations are often debated and vary among Islamic scholars. The core principle is that while some verses may seem to contradict each other, the Qur'an was revealed progressively, and the later rulings generally supersede earlier ones.
