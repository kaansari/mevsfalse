## Does Allah have hands?

Qur'anic verses emphasizing that Allah is not like His creation and does not have a body.  Also he is not a thing because all things are his creation and Allah is not created:

 > _{{< qurantext chapter="6" verse=19 en="true" >}}_

In **Surah Al-An'am (6:19)**, the word *shay’* ("thing") refers to Allah as the greatest witness. While *shay’* can mean "thing," here it emphasizes Allah's existence and role as the ultimate, incomparable witness, not a physical being. It’s a way to convey profound truths in human language while affirming His transcendence.


1. **Surah Al-Ikhlas (112:1-4)**  
   *"Say: He is Allah, UNDEFINEABLE; Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent."*

2. **Surah Ash-Shura (42:11)**  
   *"There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing."*

3. **Surah An-Nahl (16:74)**  
   *"So do not attribute to Allah equals while you know [that there is nothing comparable to Him]."*

4. **Surah Maryam (19:65)**  
   *"[He is] the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, so worship Him and have patience for His worship. Do you know of any similarity to Him?"*

    > _{{< qurantext chapter="19" verse=65 en="true" >}}_

5. **Surah Al-Isra (17:110)**  
   *"Say, 'Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever [name] you call - to Him belong the best names.' And do not recite [too] loudly in your prayer or [too] quietly but seek between that an [intermediate] way."*

    > _{{< qurantext chapter="17" verse=110 en="true" >}}_

6. **Surah Al-An'am (6:103)**  
   *"Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted."*

These verses collectively affirm that Allah is beyond human attributes, transcendent, incomparable, and not confined to physical or bodily forms.

### Metaphorical Verses
Here is a list of verses from the Quran that may seem to imply Allah has body parts but are understood by many scholars metaphorically. Classical Islamic theology often emphasizes that these descriptions are not literal but are expressions of Allah’s attributes in a way humans can comprehend.

1. **Surah Al-Qalam (68:42)**  
   *"The Day the shin will be uncovered, and they are invited to prostration but the disbelievers will not be able to."*  
   **Metaphorical meaning:** "Shin" is interpreted by scholars as a metaphor for a moment of intense severity or trial, not a physical attribute.

### Summary of the Metaphorical Understanding  
Classical Islamic scholars like Imam al-Ash'ari and Imam al-Maturidi emphasized interpreting such verses in a way that upholds Allah’s transcendence (*tanzih*). These descriptions convey attributes of power, authority, and action without implying physicality, as Allah is beyond human comprehension and not bound by the limits of creation.
