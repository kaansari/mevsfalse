## Introduction
Anyone claiming that Moses is actually Gabriel and using Surat Sajdah, Ayah 23 to back it up is basically waving a flag that says, "I might need a Quranic compass." Understanding the rich themes of the Quran is like diving into an epic adventure, and mixing up Moses and Gabriel? Well, that's like confusing the message of quran.

## Did Prophet Moses or Musa met Prophet Mohammad
The crux of the problem lies in the translation of "HE" in 'Liqaihi,' as it unmistakably gravitates toward Al Kitab, not towards Musa. While I'm open to stretching the thread of interpretation to connect it with Prophet Muhammad (SAW) meeting Musa—an intriguing notion, I must emphasize—the stretch can't be so far that it pulls 'Hudan li Bani Israel' to point to Musa.
If this were to hold true, it would shatter the established precedence in the Quran where 'Huda' is exclusively and solemnly attributed to either Allah or His divine scriptures

## Musa or Moses is Guided
Unveiling the subtleties of the verse, it becomes abundantly clear that Musa stands as the guided, not the guide.

It is even more clear here, where Musa brings the guidance and the Kitab is the guidance for the bani Israel.

The rules stays intact where even our Rasool (SAW) is mentioned as a Rehma and Quran is mentioned as a guide (Huda)

## Prophet Mohammad was also guided
And then our Rasool is told to get the guidance from Allah

> _{{< qurantext chapter="6" verse=161 en="true" >}}_

And here our Rasool is told that the guidance is not from him but only from Allah.

## Conclusion

All of the above verses and many others shows that ‘Huda’ or Guidence is exclusively and solemnly attributed to either Allah or His divine scriptures.
I acknowledge that I may have missed certain nuances. Please accept my apologies for any unintentional misinterpretation. This is solely my viewpoint, and I humbly recognize that only Allah truly knows the complete truth.
