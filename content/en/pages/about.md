## Make sure to use the ask feature
Feel free to fire away with any questions in the "Ask" text box. Thanks to the magic of AI, you'll not only get answers but also some references to dive deeper. Before shooting me any more questions via email, do take a peek at those references.

## Where am I
Now, let me paint a little picture of myself. I call the USA home, juggling life with a handful of kiddos. If your travels ever bring you to the bustling cities of LA, Boston, or Chicago, and you fancy a meet-up, let me know – I can make that happen!

## Who am I
While my roots lie in the Sunni background, my journey led me to embrace a purely Muslim path after some religious education. Let's skip the "Which school do you follow?" question, though.

## What is in this website
Oh, and there's a little something special on my website – my very own English translation of the Quran. Consider it my personal take. You don't have to see eye to eye with me on everything, but I've poured heaps of effort into this venture to arrive at the understanding I proudly share. Happy exploring!


## How to conact me

Most likely you've found your answers.  If you still feel like talking to me then email me hello@mevsfalse.com.
