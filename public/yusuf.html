                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Yusuf, Yousuf or Joseph is one of the son of Jacob (Yaqoob).
You can find him in the Egyptian methology with the name USeb (Geb).</p>
<p><img src="/img/articles/Geb.png" alt="Landscape"></p>
<h2 id="yusuf-name">Yusuf Name</h2>
<p>His name is Yusuf in the Quran. The alongation of U in his name leads us to his Egyptian name.  In the story of Yusuf, he envisions himself as a bird on his head, and this is connected to his name, U Seb (Geb), which is why you might notice a quail chick on his head.</p>
<p><img src="../img/articles/hieroglyphic-u.jpeg" alt="Landscape"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The quail chick is used for the long &ldquo;U&rdquo; sound in words like rule, pull and duel, and names like Una.
— <cite>Hieroglyph<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The pharaohs claimed Geb/Seb was their ancestor and sources refer to their throne as “the throne of Geb”. Egypt was also called “the house of Geb”.  — <cite>Ancient egypt- onlines<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-did-yusuf-look-like">What did Yusuf look like</h2>
<p>Yusuf&rsquo;s appearance isn&rsquo;t described in the Quran. Stories about his good looks are found in Talmudic folk tales, not in the Quranic account.</p>
<h2 id="yusuf-was-in-sjene-syene-fortress">Yusuf was in Sjene (Syene) fortress</h2>
<p>The Quran depicts a phase in Yusuf&rsquo;s life when he was sent to Sjene <cite>Ancient egypt fortress- city<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></cite></p>
<p>Many translate it as &ldquo;prison,&rdquo; but the modern city of Aswan was called Sjene (Syene in Hebrew). It served as a border town between the southern and northern kingdoms, functioning as a fortress for military, intelligence, soldiers, and prisoners. Unlike Genesis, the Quran precisely describes this location. Furthermore, Yusuf later becomes the head of security, supporting the idea that he had experience in wars, battles, arms, and security matters.</p>
<h2 id="yusuf-appointment-as-the-head-of-the-security">Yusuf appointment as the head of the security</h2>
<p>The Quran explicitly states Yusuf&rsquo;s role and appointment as the head of security and treasurer by the king.</p>
<p>The Quran contains verses (12:43-48) detailing the communication between the king and Yusuf. These verses stand out as unique, resembling a security cipher code. The messenger delivering the king&rsquo;s message to Yusuf uses a coded language verbatim. Remarkably, Yusuf responds in the same cipher, suggesting that their conversation is related to security matters.</p>
<h2 id="book-of-the-heavenly-cow-and-yusuf">Book of the Heavenly Cow and Yusuf</h2>
<p>In the Quran, it&rsquo;s mentioned that Yusuf not only helped the kingdom become stable but also successful. There&rsquo;s an interesting part where the Quran talks about a coded problem involving seven cows. Archaeologists found a similar story in 1922 in the burial chambers of Egyptian kings, called <cite>Book of the Heavenly Cow. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></cite></p>
<p><img src="../img/articles/7cows.jpg" alt="Landscape"></p>
<p>This myth was related to the kingdom&rsquo;s troubles and used the cow to represent important ideas. The Quran mentioning this, even before we knew about it from historical findings, shows how unique and special it is. This is why the Quran advises us not to rely on other books like the Bible or Torah.</p>
<h2 id="the-signature-of-the-chapter-yusuf">The Signature of the Chapter Yusuf</h2>
<p>The chapter starts with A,L,RA. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%90%A4%80%F0%90%A4%8B#Phoenician">AL</a>, EL, a term Jews still toss around for God. <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Ra_(Egyptian_God)/">R</a>, Rouh, RA, RE means SPIRIT in ancient egyptian.</p>
<h2 id="full-story-of-yusuf">Full story of Yusuf</h2>
<h3 id="start">Start</h3>
<p>12:1 ALR. Now, check it, these verses from the Book are for real. 12:2 We dropped this as the ultimate Read. It&rsquo;s not just for the Arabic squad – no excuses, read it on the reg to get it. 12:3 Hey Muhammad, we threw down the Qur&rsquo;an, spillin&rsquo; those ancient stories in the best way possible. You were in the dark before, but now you&rsquo;re set. You didn&rsquo;t have a clue about the people in Egypt until Allah told them with that divine revelation! 12:4 Listen up (Yaqoob or Jacob)! Joseph told his father, &lsquo;Dad, I&rsquo;m calling it – eleven stars, the sun, and the moon are all gonna be vibin&rsquo; with me. Translation? Those high-flyers who are lost? I&rsquo;m about to steer them right and have them in my orbit. Bet on it, father! 12:5 Father was like, &lsquo;Hold up, son! Keep that talk on the low. People can get shady&rsquo; He knew his righteous kid shouldn&rsquo;t spill the dream to his bros. Those dudes weren&rsquo;t exactly prophet material, and father knew envy could lead to trouble. Satan&rsquo;s always lurking as humanity&rsquo;s archenemy, you know? 12:6 He continued; Chill and keep it on the down-low. Your Rab got a plan for you – He&rsquo;ll pick you and drop some deep insights. Expect a full-on favor shower, not just on you but also on the whole Jacob crew, like He did with Abraham and Isaac. Trust, your Rab all-knowing and wise. 12:7 For real, in the tale of Joseph, his crew, and the fam, there&rsquo;s some deep wisdom for those digging for truth.</p>
<h3 id="the-scheme">The Scheme</h3>
<p>12:8 Picture this: Joseph&rsquo;s brothers scheming in the shadows, whispering like they hold all the cards. They&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;Dad&rsquo;s playing favorites with Joseph and his bro, but we&rsquo;re the ones who really know stuff, and there are way more of us. Dad&rsquo;s seriously off, man, and we can&rsquo;t let this slide.&rsquo; 12:9 So, their shady outsider pals, not bound by family ties, drop this wicked idea: &lsquo;Off Joseph, or chuck him far away. That way, your old man&rsquo;s inheritance becomes all yours. Once you&rsquo;ve done that, you&rsquo;ll be like prophets, man.&rsquo; 12:10 So, one of them suggested, &lsquo;Skip the murder, but let&rsquo;s tie Joseph down in a deep pit at a specific spot. Maybe a passing caravan will scoop him up.&rsquo; You see, they were thinking of cashing in on the scheme. 12:11 After plotting, they laid it on their dad, &lsquo;Why you doubting us about Joseph? We&rsquo;re his true homies, you know?&rsquo; 12:12 Hey, let Joseph hang with us tomorrow. We&rsquo;ll make sure he has a blast, playing and all. We&rsquo;ll be right there, keeping an eye on things. 12:13 Dad hit back, &lsquo;Nah, it really bothers me that you want to take him. I&rsquo;m worried some wolf might chow down on him while you&rsquo;re not paying attention.&rsquo; 12:14 They responded, &lsquo;Even if a wolf tried, with our strong crew and street smarts, we&rsquo;re not dumb.&rsquo; Then, in hushed tones, they whispered to each other, &lsquo;We&rsquo;d be total losers if we killed him and missed out on the cash!&rsquo; 12:15 When they took off with Joseph and schemed with their shady partners to tie him in a dark pit for a sketchy slavery deal, we hit Joseph with some wisdom: &lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be a day when you&rsquo;ll call them out for this. They&rsquo;re totally clueless about the consequences of their messed-up actions.&rsquo; 12:16 Later, they came back to their dad in the evening, crying. 12:17 They were really upset and said, &lsquo;O our father, we were out having fun and left Joseph with our stuff. A wolf came and ate him! But you won&rsquo;t believe us, no matter how honest we are.&rsquo; 12:18 They brought his shirt stained with fake blood. He said, &lsquo;No! You did something really wrong. I can only now endure with beautiful patience! I seek Allah’s help against the lie you came up with.&rsquo; 12:19 A caravan arrived, and they sent their scout to negotiate. As he approached, he asked, &lsquo;Any news?&rsquo; Those who were part of the plan said, &lsquo;There is the boy.&rsquo; They hid him after making the deal, pretending to treat him as part of their goods, while Allah was well aware of their actions. 12:20 They later traded him off for chump change, just a few darahim – like, they were desperate to ditch the boy.</p>
<h3 id="in-egypt">In Egypt</h3>
<p>12:21 The man who was a vazir in Egypt and who bought him told his wife, &lsquo;Take good care of him; he might help us, or we could even adopt him as our son.&rsquo; So, we arranged for Joseph to settle in that land and learn important things. Allah has the power to make His plans work, even though many people may not understand. 12:22 And when he hit his prime, we hooked him up with some serious wisdom and knowledge. That&rsquo;s how we roll for those who do good stuff. 12:23 And the vizier&rsquo;s wife, in whose house he was, tried to make a move on him, locking all the doors and blocking any way out of her schemes. She said, &lsquo;Everything is ready for you!&rsquo; But he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m seeking refuge with Allah. He is my Rab, and he&rsquo;s given me a good status and place to settle. Wrongdoers never win.&rsquo; 12:24 She sure tried to make a move on him, and he almost fell for it too. But, he saw proof from his Rab exposing their corruption. This is how We protected him from turning to evil and lewdness. Indeed, he was one of Our chosen servants. 12:25 After Joseph refused to take part in her evil plan, both of them rushed to the only resource, each trying to get ahead of the other. She falsely accused Joseph, damaging his authority from behind. When they reached the resorce, they found the lady&rsquo;s husband already there, seemingly involved in his wife&rsquo;s evil plan. Seeing him, she said, &lsquo;What should be the punishment for someone with bad intentions towards your wife and trying to damage her, except that he should be imprisoned or subjected to painful punishment?&rsquo; 12:26 He (Joseph) said, &lsquo;It was she who tried to tempt and lead me.&rsquo; And a witness from her family said that if he himself overstepped his authority, then she is telling the truth, and he is lying. 12:27 But if his reputation and authority have been damaged from behind, then she has lied, and he is truthful. 12:28 So when the other guy saw that Joseph was being framed and his good name was under attack, he said, &lsquo;This looks like one of those tricks from you women; your tricks are really something.&rsquo; 12:29 O Joseph, overlook this. And you, woman, seek forgiveness for your sin, for indeed, you are the one at fault. 12:30 Some ladies in the city began to say: &lsquo;The chief&rsquo;s wife, crazy in love with her young guy, is out to tempt him. We think she has lost her mind.&rsquo; 12:31 Now the woman started spreading rumors, and things got messy because she began all the lies in the first place. When the chief&rsquo;s wife heard about their sneaky talk, she called those ladies and gave them some stuff they could use against Yusuf. She even told them some things that could be used to make trouble. Then, she asked Yusuf to meet these women. When the ladies saw how good Yusuf was, they stopped planning against him, even though the chief&rsquo;s wife wanted them to. They were like, &lsquo;Whoa, this is not normal. He&rsquo;s a really good guy.&rsquo; 12:32 She said, &lsquo;So, now you get it! You blamed me for the failed plan, but the guy you accused me of trying to trick is not easily fooled. I did try to get him interested, but he resisted. However, if he doesn&rsquo;t go along with our plans, then he&rsquo;ll end up in prison, and he&rsquo;ll definitely be the one losing out.&rsquo; 12:33 Joseph said, &lsquo;My Rab! I&rsquo;d rather go to Sjene (Syene) fortress to fight and face real challenges than do what they&rsquo;re asking. If You don&rsquo;t protect me from the schemes of these women, I might give in to their temptation and make a mistake.&rsquo;</p>
<h3 id="yusuf-goes-to-the-sjene">Yusuf goes to the Sjene</h3>
<p>12:34 Thereupon, his Rab granted his prayer and kept him safe from their schemes. Surely, He alone is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. 12:35 Then he accidentally revealed his true identity to them. After they noticed all the signs he was showing, they decided to get rid of him for a while. 12:36 And two guys ended up in the fortress with him. One said, &lsquo;Once I&rsquo;m out of here, I&rsquo;m gonna chill with the elites.&rsquo; And the last one (Yusuf) said, &lsquo;I see myself sharing smart stuff with the King.&rsquo; The other guy teased, &lsquo;Let us know how that goes. You seem too good, almost like a newbie.&rsquo; 12:37 He said in reply, &lsquo;I can explain any knowledge that comes your way, even before you figure it out its true realization. My Rab gave me this knowledge and book. I left the fancy life of those rich folks who don&rsquo;t believe in Allah or the afterlife; they&rsquo;re just into getting more and more.&rsquo; 12:38 And I&rsquo;ve been following the path of my fathers, Ibrahim, Ishaq, and Yaqub. We don&rsquo;t do the whole associating partners with Allah thing. This is all thanks to Allah&rsquo;s kindness to us and everyone, but most people don&rsquo;t really appreciate it. 12:39 Hey my fellow comrade in the fortress , are multiple gods better or is Allah, the One and All-Powerful, the best? 12:40 Whatever you worship besides Him are just made-up names, you and your ancestors. Allah hasn&rsquo;t given them any authority to make up stuff. All authority belongs to Allah, and He has decreed that you should only worship Him. That&rsquo;s the right path, but most people don&rsquo;t know. 12:41 Hey, my fellow comrade of the fortress, one of you will serve wine to his king, while the last one (me), will have his true lineage revealed, and the king will benefit from his knowledge. The matter you&rsquo;re curious about has already been settled. 12:42 And Yusuf said to the guy who was probably getting out soon, &lsquo;Tell your King about me.&rsquo; But then, Satan made him forget to mention to his King. So, Yusuf stayed in the Sjene (Syene) for a bit longer. 12:43 And one day, the king said to his courtiers, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed noble women around me being schemed against and put in danger by the greedy ones. Among them are young women, and all of them seem shallow and dry. O my council, tell me about this if you know what I&rsquo;m talking about.&rsquo; 12:44 They said, &lsquo;It seems like a mix-up caused by some young crowd, and we don&rsquo;t know what those know-it-all youngsters are seeing.&rsquo; 12:45 Then, one of the two comrades, the one who had returned from the Syene (Sjene) , spoke in a coded language about what Yusuf had said. He stated, &lsquo;I will tell you what&rsquo;s going on; just send me back as a messenger.&rsquo; 12:46 He said, &lsquo;O Yusuf, the trustworthy friend.&rsquo; Then he gave him the message from the king verbatim, without changing a single word. 12:47 In the next five verses, Yusuf sent a coded message back. It&rsquo;s all in cipher, and truly, Allah knows the meaning. The rest of the chapter is to be continued (TBC).</p>
