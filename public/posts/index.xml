      <description>The difference between Ataa (come) and Ja&amp;rsquo;a (come) in arabic The difference between “جاء” (jāʾa) and “أتى” (ʾatā) in Arabic lies in their meanings and usage: 1.	جاء (jāʾa): •	Often used to indicate arrival or coming from a distant place. •	It focuses on the result of the action, which is the arrival at the destination. •	Example: “جاء أحمد إلى المنزل” (“Ahmed came to the house”). This implies that Ahmed arrived at the house.</description>

      <description>No Abrogation in the Qur’an
There is no abrogation (naskh) in the Qur’an. All its verses remain valid and harmonious. When chapter 2 mentions abrogation, it refers to the replacement of previous scriptures with the superior guidance of the Qur’an, not the cancellation of Qur’anic verses themselves.
۞مَا نَنسَخۡ مِنۡ ءَايَةٍ أَوۡ نُنسِهَا نَأۡتِ بِخَيۡرٖ مِّنۡهَآ أَوۡ مِثۡلِهَآۗ أَلَمۡ تَعۡلَمۡ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرٌ 2:106 Examples Often Misinterpreted as Abrogation .</description>

      <description>Introduction Yusuf, Yousuf or Joseph is one of the son of Jacob (Yaqoob). You can find him in the Egyptian methology with the name USeb (Geb).
Yusuf Name His name is Yusuf in the Quran. The alongation of U in his name leads us to his Egyptian name. In the story of Yusuf, he envisions himself as a bird on his head, and this is connected to his name, U Seb (Geb), which is why you might notice a quail chick on his head.</description>

      <title>Story of Ismail</title>

      <description>Ismail Family Meet the prophet, Abraham, a.k.a Ibrahim or Ibraheem, the pioneer prophet in the Quranic saga. His father&amp;rsquo;s name is Azar. He has three children named Ismael, Ishaaq, and Yaqub. All three kids are considered prophets in the Quran.
Prophet Ismael goes by Ismail, Ishmael, and Ismaeil. He&amp;rsquo;s the first son of Ibrahim. The Quran talks about Ibrahim&amp;rsquo;s wife but doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention her name. Some traditions say it&amp;rsquo;s Sarah or Sara or Sarai, but that&amp;rsquo;s just a story and isn&amp;rsquo;t confirmed by the Quran.</description>

      <title>Musa is not Jibreel</title>

      <description>Introduction Anyone claiming that Moses is actually Gabriel and using Surat Sajdah, Ayah 23 to back it up is basically waving a flag that says, &amp;ldquo;I might need a Quranic compass.&amp;rdquo; Understanding the rich themes of the Quran is like diving into an epic adventure, and mixing up Moses and Gabriel? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s like confusing the message of quran.
وَلَقَدۡ ءَاتَيۡنَا مُوسَى ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ فَلَا تَكُن فِي مِرۡيَةٖ مِّن لِّقَآئِهِۦۖ وَجَعَلۡنَٰهُ هُدٗى لِّبَنِيٓ إِسۡرَـٰٓءِيلَ 32:23 — Quran1</description>

      <title>Darham (Money) in Quran</title>

      <description>Quran sometimes throws in words from other languages. Let&amp;rsquo;s take words like Darham and more.
When yousuf was sold Allah&amp;rsquo;s playing 4D chess, going for &amp;ldquo;Darahim&amp;rdquo; in the Yousuf story instead of &amp;ldquo;Dinar.&amp;rdquo; Why? &amp;ldquo;Dinar&amp;rdquo; would be all about coins, but &amp;ldquo;Darahim,&amp;rdquo; straight from Sanskrit, brings that fixed trade value vibe. Allah, dropping knowledge ahead of the coin game that only kicked in during Justinian&amp;rsquo;s time around 541 CE. Peep the Turkish museum pic – that coin truth!</description>
